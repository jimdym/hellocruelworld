# hellocruelworld
a repository to learn how it all works
i've done too many hello world programs and to make them interesting i rarely follow the instructions anymore. this sometimes leads to mistakes that are very instructive to get undone. i have little attachment to any programming language or methodology except for a couple that I absolutely detest (cobol pops to mind) and I'm getting a little tired of learning bits and snatches of languages every time I get involved in someone else's problem.
